## About

I work in **Global Analytics & Reporting** at **D. E. Shaw**, supporting data-driven decision-making through analytics, modeling, and reporting. I have **1.5+ years** of experience across financial analytics, machine learning, and applied data science, with a dual degree from **BITS Pilani** (B.E. Electrical & Electronics, M.Sc. Mathematics) and a minor in Data Science.

My work spans **Customer Experience & Operations Analytics**, **Risk & Fraud Detection**, and **AI-driven systems** — at Piramal Finance I built AI agents, document parsing systems, and analytics pipelines; earlier at ITC and CSIR I did FMCG analytics and ML research. I'm interested in problems at the intersection of **data, decision science, and business strategy**.
