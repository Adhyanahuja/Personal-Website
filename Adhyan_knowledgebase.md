## About

I currently work in the **Global Analytics & Reporting** team at **D. E. Shaw**, supporting data-driven decision-making through analytics, modeling, and structured reporting.

I bring **1.5 years of experience** across financial analytics, machine learning, and applied data science, complemented by a **dual degree from BITS Pilani** (B.E. Electrical & Electronics, M.Sc. Mathematics) and a **minor in Data Science**. My background spans **Customer Experience & Operations Analytics**, **Risk & Fraud Detection**, and **AI-driven systems**, with hands-on experience at **Piramal Finance**, **ITC**, and **CSIR**.

At Piramal Finance, I worked across customer experience and operations analytics, where I built **AI agents**, **intelligent document parsing systems**, and **end-to-end analytics pipelines** to automate insights, improve decision workflows, and drive operational efficiency at scale. Earlier, I contributed to **FMCG analytics at ITC** and **machine learning research at CSIR**, shaping a strong foundation in both business-facing analytics and research-driven problem solving.

I am particularly interested in problems at the intersection of **data, decision science, and business strategy**, where rigorous analysis meets real-world impact. Outside work, I closely follow **sports and financial markets** and enjoy thinking about **investing through a quantitative lens**. I value continuous learning and meaningful conversations with people who enjoy solving hard problems thoughtfully.
